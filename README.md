# EduFact  
### Generative AI Hallucination Checker & Truth Scoring Prototype

EduFact is a **Generative AI prototype** designed to **evaluate the factual accuracy of AI-generated content** and assign a **truth/accuracy score**—without modifying or rewriting the original output.

The project focuses on **responsible AI use**, **academic integrity**, and **decision support**, with applications in **education, analytics, and supply chain management**.

## 🔗 Try the App (Live Prototype)

You can try the **EduFact prototype** here:

👉 **Live Demo:** https://opal.google/?flow=drive:/1v_4ES9EDF0-D5nrJc34w1BEkAP4kd4tw&shared&mode=app

This interactive demo allows users to:
- Paste **AI-generated content**
- Receive a **truth / accuracy score**
- Identify **potential hallucinations or unverifiable claims**
- Evaluate reliability **without altering the original text**

> ⚠️ Note: This is a **prototype for academic and experimental use**.  
> Results should be interpreted with **human judgment**.

## 🚀 Project Motivation

Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate fluent responses that may still contain **hallucinations**—confident but incorrect claims.

EduFact was created to address a key question:

> *How can users trust AI-generated content without blindly accepting it?*

EduFact helps users **assess reliability**, not edit content—making it suitable for **academic, analytical, and professional settings**.

## 🧠 What EduFact Does

- Accepts **AI-generated text** as input  
- **Evaluates factual claims** using structured validation prompts  
- Assigns an **accuracy / truth score**  
- Flags **potential hallucinations or unverifiable statements**  
- Preserves the **original AI response** (no rewriting or correction)

✅ Focuses on **evaluation**, not generation  
✅ Supports **responsible and ethical GenAI usage**

## 🛠️ Current Status

- 🔧 **Prototype stage**
- 📊 Actively conducting **market research and use-case validation**
- 🧪 Tested on educational, analytical, and supply-chain-related content
- ❌ Not a registered company or commercial product

## 📌 Core Features

- **Hallucination Detection** – Identifies claims that may lack factual grounding  
- **Truth / Accuracy Scoring** – Quantifies reliability instead of binary results  
- **Explainability-focused prompts** – Encourages transparent reasoning  
- **Domain-agnostic design** – Applicable across education, supply chain, and analytics  
- **Academic Integrity Friendly** – Designed for ethical AI use in learning environments

## 📦 Example Use Cases

### 🎓 Education
- Students validating AI-generated explanations  
- Teaching Assistants reviewing AI-assisted submissions  

### 📦 Supply Chain Analytics
- Verifying AI insights on inventory, forecasting, logistics, and disruptions  

### 🧠 Decision Support
- Evaluating AI summaries before academic or managerial use  

### 📚 Research & Writing
- Checking factual reliability without altering author intent  

---

## 🧩 How It Works (High-Level)

1. User provides **AI-generated content**
2. EduFact breaks content into **verifiable claims**
3. Claims are assessed using **structured validation prompts**
4. Each claim is categorized as:
   - Likely correct  
   - Uncertain  
   - Potential hallucination
5. An **overall truth/accuracy score** is produced

> ⚠️ EduFact does **not** correct content—it only evaluates reliability.

## 🔐 Responsible AI Principles

EduFact is built with the following principles:

- Transparency over blind automation  
- Human judgment remains central  
- No content manipulation or rewriting  
- Awareness of model bias and limitations  

---

## 🧑‍💻 Tech & Skills Demonstrated

- Prompt engineering & validation workflows  
- Generative AI evaluation logic  
- Ethical AI & hallucination awareness
